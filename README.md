Welcome to Advanced AI and ML!

Project Overview

This project develops a machine learning solution to predict customer churn for a subscription-based telecommunications company. The goal is to identify customers at risk of churning so organizations can take proactive retention actions. The project uses supervised learning techniques, including Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers, and evaluates model performance using industry standard metrics.

Software Requirements:

Python: Version 3.9 or higher

Jupyter Notebook/ Colab

Git (for version control)

Operating System: Windows 10/11, macOS, or Linux

Python Libraries

The following Python libraries are required:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib

Hardware Requirements:

Personal computer or laptop
Minimum 8 GB RAM (16 GB recommended)
Modern CPU (no dedicated GPU required)
At least 500 MB of available disk space



Instructions to Run the Application:

Clone the GitLab repository

git clone <repository-url>
cd d683-advanced-ai-and-ml

Install required Python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

Launch Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook

Open the notebook

Open churn_model.ipynb from the Jupyter interface.

Run the notebook

Execute all cells sequentially from top to bottom.

The notebook performs:

Data preprocessing
Model training (Logistic Regression and Random Forest)
Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
Confusion matrix visualization
Cross-validation
Hyperparameter tuning
Feature importance analysis

Review results

Evaluation metrics and visualizations are displayed directly in the notebook output cells.

Model Evaluation Metrics
The models are evaluated using:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-score
ROC-AUC
Confusion Matrix (visualized)

Notes

This project uses a publicly available dataset and does not involve proprietary or sensitive data.
All preprocessing and modeling steps are fully reproducible.
The project is intended for educational and academic demonstration purposes.
